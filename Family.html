<h1 style="font-size:40px">Family Structure:</h1>
<br><br>
<p style="font-size:20px"><b>A family is very important to most Nigerians. 
There are two major family types; the nuclear family, which is made up of one man, his wife, and their unmarried children, and an extended family, which is usually made up of a series of nuclear families.
 A normal Nigerian family consists of a mother, father, and children. Many include grandparents, uncles, and aunts.
 Families in urban areas usually have 3-5 children while people living in rural areas have 7-10 children. 
Nigerians have respect for their elders and grown children are expected to care for their parents as they age. In Nigeria, having many children is a symbol or sign of a high status. 
Even though a big family costs more from a financial point of view, many families in the eastern Nigeria have ten or more children. The national fertility rate was estimated at 6.31 children per woman in 1995.
 The birth rate was 43.26 births per 1,000 people, while the death rate was 12 deaths per 1,000 people. <b></p>
