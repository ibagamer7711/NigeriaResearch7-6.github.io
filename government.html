 <p style="font-size:20px"><b>Nigeria gained independence from the United Kingdom on October 1, 1960 and by 1996 there 36 different states created. The Federal government of Nigeria is created from three different branches: legislative, executive, and judicial.
 Although there is still corruption and terrorism in the political sector, the Constitution tries to provide a balance of powers among the three branches of government and intends to avoid the repetition of past mistakes made by the government.
 Nigerian politics works within a framework of a federal, presidential, representative democratic republic, in which administrative power is exercised by the government.
 Legislative power is held by the federal government and the two types of the legislature: the house of representatives and the senate.<b></p>
